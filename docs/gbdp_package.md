# GDBP_Package
## What is it, actually? 
This package is like a word of speech for GDBP, it's basically a wrapper for information sent to and from DB_Nodes.

## Basic structure
It's not rocket science, the structure of each package looks more or less as follows: 
   `"{Communicat} {first value} {second value}"`, provided that current operation supports 2 values (some need one or zero values).
